████████ ,

What a cutie!  █████ is adorable and so grown up now!  ███ should start talking
before long if ███ has not already.  I'm sure that you are teaching ███ to
say █████.  I hope you ████ are doing well.  I understand ██ Edward is not
doing as well as hoped.  That must be particularly difficult for you ████
since you are not near by.

When do you think that you will be in ███████ again?  We ████ you ████.  We
got used to your being around █████████.

Meredith is doing well.  ███ is starting to sit well on ███ own.  ███ still
does an occasional face-plant though.  It really makes ███ mad when ███
does.  ███ loves ███ exersaucer.  We went to ████████ for Easter day so Meredith
had ███ first plane ride.  ███ did very well.  I can't imagine entertaining a
baby for five hours on a plane like you do!  Meredith has not mastered cereal
yet.  We only feed ███ twice a week which does not help.  We keep joking that
███ will still be on formula when ███ goes to kindergarden!

I will send some picutures of Meredith soon.

█████
